- 📝 **Well-formatted file contents** with clear section headers for each file
- ⏱️ **Progress tracking** with real-time status updates
- 🖥️ **Responsive design** that remains accessible during processing operations

## 🚀 Typical Use Cases

- 🤖 Preparing codebases for analysis by Large Language Models
- 📚 Creating comprehensive code documentation
- 👁️ Enabling easier code reviews of complete projects
